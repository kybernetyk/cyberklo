Go implementation of the bencoding protocol

I played around with io.Reader interface but it made the code
too complicated. We'll see after I've built a simple BT client
if I need io.Reader support or if feeding with []byte will work.

The encoder's reflection capabilities are not that great.
The only objects "understood" by the encoder are string, int/in64, 
[]interface{} and map[string]interface{}.
If you need to encode your custom structs, you're welcome to extend
this package. :)
