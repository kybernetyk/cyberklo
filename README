klospuelung -> irc gateway

whenever I flush my toilet a lucky irc chan will be informed

this project is bigger than life! it involves:
	* hardcore hardware haxx0ring (closing a switch)
	* hardcore arduino pwnage (reading the switch state and forwarding it to my pc)
	* hardcore general purpose comput0ring (forwarding the state to the irc)

yes, I am fucking bored!
